# LinkedIn

Oauth 2.0 Ruby wrapper for the [LinkedIn API](http://developer.linkedin.com). Heavily inspired by [pengwynn/linkedin](https://github.com/pengwynn/linkedin)'s Oauth 1.0 Linkedin API interface. Most methods are the same as pengwynn/linkedin's gem, but major terminology changes make this incompatible.

Travis CI : [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/emorikawa/linkedin-oauth2.png)](http://travis-ci.org/emorikawa/linkedin-oauth2)

## Installation

    [sudo] gem install linkedin-oauth2

## Usage

### Authenticate Overview

LinkedIn's API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Luckily, this gem hides most of the gory details from you.

The gory details can be found [here](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/authentication)

For legacy support of LinkedIn's OAuth 1.0a api, refer to the [pengwynn/linkedin](https://github.com/pengwynn/linkedin) gem.

Basically, you need 3 things to start using LinkedIn's API:

1. Your application's `client_id` aka **API Key**
1. Your application's `client_secret` aka **Secret Key**
1. An `access_token` from a user who authorized your app.

### If you already have a user's `access_token`
Then you have already authenticated! Encoded within that access token are
all of the permissions you have on a given user. Assuming you requested
the appropriate permissions, you can read their profile, grab connections,
etc.

    client = LinkedIn::Client.new("<your client_id>",
                                  "<your client_secret>",
                                  "<user access_token>")
    client.profile

You may also use the `set_access_token` method.

    client.set_access_token("<user access_token>", options)

### If you need to fetch an `access_token` for a user.
There are 4 steps:

1. Setup a client using your application's `client_id` and `client_secret`

    client = LinkedIn::Client.new('your_client_id', 'your_client_secret')

2. Get the `authorize_url` to bring up the page that will ask a user
   to verify permissions & grant you access.

    authorize_url = client.authorize_url

3. Once a user signs in to your OAuth 2.0 box, you will get an
   `auth_code` aka **code**. (Check in url you were directed to after a
   successful auth). Use this **auth code** to request the
   **access token**.

    access_token = client.request_access_token("<auth_code from last step>")

4. Once you have an `access_token`, you can request profile information or
   anything else you have permissions for.

    client.profile

### Profile examples
```ruby
# get the profile for the authenticated user
client.profile

# get a profile for someone found in network via ID
client.profile(:id => 'gNma67_AdI')

# get a profile for someone via their public profile url
client.profile(:url => 'http://www.linkedin.com/in/netherland')
```

For a nice example on using this in a [Rails App](http://pivotallabs.com/users/will/blog/articles/1096-linkedin-gem-for-a-web-app).

If you want to play with the LinkedIn api without using the gem, have a look at the [apigee LinkedIn console](http://app.apigee.com/console/linkedin).

## Migration from OAuth 1.0a to OAuth 2.0
### Overall changes
* The term `consumer` is now referred to as the `client`
* The terms `token`, `consumer token`, or `consumer key` in OAuth 1.0 are now referred to as **`client_id`** in OAuth 2.0
* The terms `secret`, or `consumer secret` in OAuth 1.0 are now referred to as **`client_secret`** in OAuth 2.0
* In OAuth 1.0 there is both an `auth token` and an `auth secret`. OAuth 2.0 combines these into a single `access token`.
* The terms `auth token`, `auth key`, `auth secret`, `access secret`, `access token`, or `access key` have all been collapsed and are now referred to as the **`access token`**.
* `require` `linkedin-oauth2` instead of `linkedin`
* Removed proxy options

### Gem api changes
* In general, any place that said "consumer" now says "client"
* The `authorize_from_request` method has been deprecated. Instead
  navigate to the url from `authorize_url` then enter the returned code
  into the `request_access_token` method.
* The `authorize_from_access` method has been deprecated. Instead
  initialize the `LinkedIn::Client.new` with the `access_token`.
  `client = Linkedin::Client.new(client_id, client_secret, access_token)`


## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

## Testing
Run `bundle install`
