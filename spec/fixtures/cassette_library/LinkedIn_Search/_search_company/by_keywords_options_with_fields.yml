      was founded in 1906 in Rochester, New York as \\\"The Haloid Company\\\", which
      originally manufactured photographic paper and equipment. The company subsequently
      changed its name to \\\"Haloid Xerox\\\" in 1958 and then simply \\\"Xerox\\\"
      in 1961. The company came to prominence in 1959 with the introduction of the
      first plain paper photocopier using the process of xerography developed by Chester
      Carlson, the Xerox 914. Before releasing the 914, Xerox had also introduced
      the first xerographic printer, the \\\"Copyflo\\\" in 1955.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970
      Xerox opened the Xerox PARC research facility. The facility developed many modern
      computing methods such as the mouse and the graphical user interface. From these
      inventions, Xerox PARC created the Xerox Alto in 1973, a small minicomputer
      similar to a workstation and personal computer. The Alto was never commercially
      sold, as Xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it. In 1979, several
      Apple Computer employees, including Steve Jobs, visited Xerox PARC, interested
      in seeing their developments. Jobs and the others saw the commercial potential
      of the GUI and mouse, and began development of the Apple Lisa, which Apple introduced
      in 1983.\\r\\n \\r\\nHeadquartered in Norwalk, Conn., today Xerox  is a $22
